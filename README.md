# IETF122-Sidemeeting-High-performance WAN

Data-intensive applications demand high-speed data transmission over WANs such as scientific research, academia, education as 
disccussed in draft-kcrh-hpwan-state-of-art and other applications in public networks as per draft-yx-hpwan-uc-requirements-public-operator.
The specific requirements of HP-WANs applications mainly focus on the massive data transmission over long-distance WANs within a 
completion time. It is crucial to achieve high-throughput while ensuring the efficient use of capacity, but the performance will be impacted by
the issues related to existing transport protocols and congestion control mechanisms such as poor convergence speed, long feedback loop, 
unscheduled traffic and adaptation of different transport protocols as per draft-xiong-hpwan-problem-statement. The specific technical requirements 
of HP-WANs may encompass a wide range of aspects to enable host-network collaboration upon more active network involvement including transport-related
technologies such as proxy, flow control, QoS negotiation, congestion control, admission control and traffic scheduling, and also involving 
routing-related technologies like traffic engineering, resource scheduling, and load balancing.

We're planning to have a side meeting at IETF 122: High-performance WAN. This sidemeeting follows up discussions of HP-WAN use cases, requirements, problems 
deployment and technical solutions upon IETF121 BoF and online meeting.
